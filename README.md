# WORK IN PROGRESS
The files in this github page are currently just samples from my simulations, the jupyter notebook UBC_test_3.ipnyb, shows an example of using the builtin sionna functions to generate a radio map, along with some of the functions I have added on in a "radio_functions" supplement script

Open the UBC_test_3.ipnyb script and change around the transmitter positions or other values to get started.  

Note that I haven't finished the documentation for the radio_functions.py script, however I will do so by the end of the project (I just included it here to be able to be able to calculate auxilliary values in the UBC_test_3.ipnyb script
